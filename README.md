## Welcome!
This is my web portfolio. Right now, it's basically intended to be an edgy online presence for employers and professionals in my industry: computer programming (very broad, I know; I'm still figuring myself out). 

This website will contain my social media, hackathon and personal projects, a little bit about me, and my resume. I will add more cool stuff as I think of it (blog, virtual assistant, cool videos I've found on Youtube...)

## Credits
This website was pretty easy to make. I have to give credit to:
* Bootstrap https://getbootstrap.com/
* Google Fonts: https://fonts.google.com/
* jQuery: https://jquery.com/
* Popper.js: https://popper.js.org/

There will be more, trust me.

## TODO
* virtual assistant with my voice (WAY long term. Sorry.)
* blog
* Youtube videos that I like. VSauce comes to mind.
* basic programming tutorials taught by me? Like thenewboston...
* link to iOS game that I will have made
* recipes that I've invented
* homepage of the resistance to Amazon's dominion
