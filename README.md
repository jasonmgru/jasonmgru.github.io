## Welcome!
This is my web portfolio. Right now, it's basically intended to be an edgy online presence for employers and professionals in my industry: computer programming (very broad, I know; I'm still figuring myself out). 

This website will contain my social media, hackathon and personal projects, a little bit about me, and my resume. I will add more cool stuff as I think of it (blog, virtual assistant, cool videos I've found on Youtube...)

## How to use
My portfolio page is currently hosted by GitHub pages. Go to https://jasonmgru.github.io/ to see the hosted page. 

If, instead, you want to download the page (and source files) and view them locally, clone this repository and click index.html.
